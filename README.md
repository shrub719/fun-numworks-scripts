### [Renderer](src/renderer/renderer.py)
A 3D object renderer which can rotate and scale an object.  
Also needs [Renderer Config](src/renderer/r_config.py) to be downloaded. Edit the constants
at the bottom to change settings.

`D-Pad`: pitch & yaw  
`SHIFT / ALPHA`: roll  
`- / +`: scale
`รท / ร`: point size 

### [Canvas](src/canvas.py)
A canvas that you can draw on.

`D-Pad`: move cursor  
`OK`: draw

`BACKSPACE`: hold to slow down  
`1`: switch colour to black  
`2`: switch to white/eraser  
`4 5 6`: red/green/blue

### [Drummer](src/drummer.py)
Like a drummer/launchpad.

Use the number keys to play the drums. Press `.` to change colours.

### [Keys](src/keys.py)
Like one of those MIDI piano YouTube videos.

Use the top row of numbers `7 8 9 ( )` to play the piano keys. Press `EXE` to change colours.

### [Picker](src/picker.py)
A simple colour picker.

`4 5 6`: increase R/G/B value  
`1 2 3`: decrease R/G/B value  
`BACK`: output RGB value and exit
