### [Renderer](https://my.numworks.com/python/shrub719/renderer)
A 3D object renderer which can rotate and scale an object.  
For more objects, configuration, and the ability to add custom objects,
download [Renderer Config](https://my.numworks.com/python/shrub719/r_config) as well.

`D-Pad`: pitch & yaw  
`SHIFT / ALPHA`: roll  
`- / +`: scale  
`รท / ร`: point size 

#### [Renderer Config](https://my.numworks.com/python/shrub719/r_config)
A companion script for [Renderer](https://my.numworks.com/python/shrub719/renderer).  

Edit the constants at the bottom for configuration.  
Objects are lists of (normalised) points as tuples.  
Colours are tuples of RGB multipliers, max `(1, 1, 1)`.  
To add your own objects/colours, write an external script and import it at the bottom.


### [Canvas](https://my.numworks.com/python/shrub719/canvas)
A canvas that you can draw on.

`D-Pad`: move cursor  
`OK`: draw  
`TOOLBOX`: hold to speed up  
`BACKSPACE`: hold to slow down  
`1`: switch colour to black  
`2`: switch to white/eraser  
`4 5 6`: red/green/blue

### [Drummer](https://my.numworks.com/python/shrub719/drummer)
Like a drummer/launchpad.

Use the number keys to play the drums. Press `.` to change colours.

### [Keys](https://my.numworks.com/python/shrub719/keys)
Like one of those MIDI piano YouTube videos.

Use the top row of numbers `7 8 9 ( )` to play the piano keys. Press `EXE` to change colours.

### [Picker](https://my.numworks.com/python/shrub719/picker)
A simple colour picker.

`4 5 6`: increase R/G/B value  
`1 2 3`: decrease R/G/B value  
`BACK`: output RGB value and exit
